# Corrupted LibriSpeech

This dataset is constructed by training a character-based [Conv1d-LSTM](https://github.com/proger/haloop) on train-other-500 and train-clean-360 and decoding train-clean-100 after every epoch. The intended use of this system is training active learning / utterance verification systems.
